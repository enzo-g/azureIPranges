> **Note:** The latest updates generated by the GitHub Action can be viewed at this page: [https://enzo-g.github.io/azureIPranges/](https://enzo-g.github.io/azureIPranges/)

A Python utility for automatically retrieving, processing, and organizing Microsoft Azure service IP ranges.  
Source: [Microsoft Azure IP Ranges JSON](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519)

## Features

- Automatically fetches the latest Azure IP ranges JSON file
- Processes and organizes IP ranges by service
- Creates individual text files for each Azure service
- Maintains a history of JSON files
- Generates a user-friendly web interface to browse the data
- Format compatible with Palo Alto Networks (PA) devices

## How It Works

The script performs the following operations:
1. Downloads the latest JSON file from Microsoft's download page
2. Extracts unique system services and their IP ranges
3. Creates separate text files for each service in the `ranges-services-pa` directory
4. Maintains a history of JSON files in the `json-history` directory
5. Generates an index page for easy browsing

## Automated Updates

The repository is automatically updated through GitHub Actions to ensure you always have access to the latest IP ranges. Each service's IP ranges are stored in individual text files, making it easy to integrate with your existing systems.

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Fork the Repository**: It's recommended to fork this repository to maintain control over updates and modifications
2. **Regular Updates**: Microsoft updates the JSON file weekly - ensure you stay current
3. **Network Security Groups**: These service tags can be used to simplify NSG rules in Azure deployments
   - Note: Some service tags might not be available in all clouds and regions
4. **Verification**: Always verify the IP ranges against your requirements before implementation

## Implementation Notes

The script organizes IP ranges in a format compatible with Palo Alto Networks (PA) devices. Each service's IP ranges are stored in a separate text file for easy reference and implementation.
